- **Continuous qubit trajectories**\
    In circuit QED we infer the state of a quantum bit (_qubit_) by making a quadrature measurement on an interacting microwave resonator field. Achieving high-fidelity state-tracking from the collected noisy quadrature signal is a necessary prerequisite for more sophisticated quantum information tasks. <br/><br/>

- **Quantum feedback and control**\
    One can continuously monitor partial information about a quantum system in order to control experimental parameters in real time for a variety of purposes, such as state purification and initialization, coherence stabilization, and error correction. <br/>\

- **Correlated multi-qubit measurement**\
    The expected advantages of quantum computing are rooted in multi-qubit coherence and entanglement effects, with information extracted through uncorrelated high-fidelity projective measurements. A less-explored possibility is exploiting the spatio-temporal correlations between generalized (e.g. weaker) measurements to extract useful information. <br/>\

- **Quantum Parameter Estimation**\
    Determining how well one is modeling the physical system in the lab is not a trivial matter. Modern tomographic methods under development use compressive sensing and adaptive estimation techniques to reduce the amount of data that one needs to collect, and reduce the computational resources required to reconstruct the estimates. <br/>\

- **Machine Learning for Device Characterization**\
    As chips become more complex in the laboratory, calibration and tune-up becomes an increasingly daunting task. Modern machine learning methods offer novel solutions for auto-calibrating device parameters and tracking dynamics occuring during a computational run. <br/>\
