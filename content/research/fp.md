- **Quantum Weak Values**\
    Averaging weak measurements of a pre- and post-selected ensemble consistently produces an average described by a curious quantity known as a _weak value_, rather than the usual expectation value. These quantities appear througohut the quantum formalism in surprising ways and are closely related to quasiprobabilistic descriptions of joint observable statistics.<br/>\

- **Contextuality, Locality, and Macrorealism**\
    While most agree that quantum mechanics is weird, it is more difficult to quantify that weirdness in a satisfying (and experimentally accessible) way. The arguably most successful efforts have isolated specific axioms that are aligned with our macroscopic intuition of the physical world (e.g., noncontextual value assignment, locality, and realism), and have constructed rigorous tests to show exactly where quantum mechanics violates these seemingly safe assumptions.<br/>\

- **Noncommutative Probability Theory**\
    The infamous "state collapse" in the quantum theory can be understood as a straightforward generalization of Bayes' theorem in classical probability theory. This observation places probability distributions and quantum states on analogous footing, making the study of noncommutative probability theory a promising route toward reformulating the quantum theory.<br/>\

- **Applications of Clifford Algebras**\
    Through an accident of historical development, the practical application of Clifford algebras has been left largely undeveloped in favor of less expressive mathematical formalisms (e.g., the vector calculus of Gibbs/Heaviside). More careful scrutiny reveals that Clifford algebras greatly simplify the mathematical expression of physical law in highly suggestive ways. One example is the unification of Maxwell's equations into a single equation: &nabla;<b>F</b> = <b>j</b>, where <b>F</b> = <b>E</b>+<b>B</b>I is the proper (frame-independent) generalization of the Riemann-Silberstein complex electromagnetic field vector, <b>j</b> is the 4-vector current density, &nabla; is the same Dirac differential operator as for the relativistic quantum electron, and I is the intrinsic pseudoscalar (volume element) of spacetime.

- **Relativistic Fields**\
    Even before introducing second quantization, relativistic fields have remarkably rich structure that is important for practical applications. Notably, modern experimental research in classical optics has forced the reinvestigation of troublesome topics, such as the local momentum of optical vortex singularities, and the proper theoretical separation of orbital and spin parts of the angular momentum density (which can be separately measured with probe particles).<br/>\
