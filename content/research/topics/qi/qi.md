## Quantum Computing with Superconducting Qubits

![Quantum trajectories of Rabi oscillations](RabiTrajectories.jpg "Superconducting transmon quantum bits are measured via their dispersive interaction with a neighboring microwave resonator. The interaction produces a state-dependent phase shift of a continuous microwave field, which can be detected as a continuous but noisy voltage signal using a homodyne measurement of the reflected microwave field. This continuous noisy voltage produces stochastic quantum trajectories, which have rich statistics. [Nature **511**, 570 (2014)]")

- **Continuous qubit trajectories**\
  In circuit QED we infer the state of a quantum bit (<i>qubit</i>) by making a quadrature measurement on an interacting microwave resonator field. Achieving high-fidelity state-tracking from the collected noisy quadrature signal is a necessary prerequisite for more sophisticated quantum information tasks.
- **Quantum feedback and control**\
  One can continuously monitor partial information about a quantum system in order to control experimental parameters in real time for a variety of purposes, such as state purification and initialization, coherence stabilization, and error correction.
- **Correlated multi-qubit measurement**\
  The expected advantages of quantum computing are rooted in multi-qubit coherence and entanglement effects, with information extracted through uncorrelated high-fidelity projective measurements. A less-explored possibility is exploiting the correlations between simultaneous continuous records to extract useful information.
- **Quantum Parameter Estimation**\
  Determining how well one is modeling the physical system in the lab is not a trivial matter. Modern tomographic methods under development use compressive sensing and adaptive estimation techniques to reduce the amount of data that one needs to collect, and reduce the computational resources required to reconstruct the estimates.
