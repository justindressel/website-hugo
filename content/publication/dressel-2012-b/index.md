abstract: We theoretically investigate a generalized “which-path” measurement on an
  electronic Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) implemented via Coulomb coupling to
  a second electronic MZI acting as a detector. The use of contextual values, or generalized
  eigenvalues, enables the precise construction of which-path operator averages that
  are valid for any measurement strength from the available drain currents. The form
  of the contextual values provides direct physical insight about the measurement
  being performed, providing information about the correlation strength between system
  and detector, the measurement inefficiency, and the proper background removal. We
  find that the detector interferometer must display maximal wavelike behavior to
  optimally measure the particle-like which-path information in the system interferometer,
  demonstrating wave-particle complementarity between the system and detector. We
  also find that the degree of quantum erasure that can be achieved by conditioning
  on a specific detector drain is directly related to the ambiguity of the measurement.
  Finally, conditioning the which-path averages on a particular system drain using
  the zero-frequency cross correlations produces conditioned averages that can become
  anomalously large due to quantum interference; the weak-coupling limit of these
  conditioned averages can produce both weak and detector-dependent semiweak values.
