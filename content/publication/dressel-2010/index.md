abstract: We introduce contextual values as a generalization of the eigenvalues of
  an observable that takes into account both the system observable and a general measurement
  procedure. This technique leads to a natural definition of a general conditioned
  average that converges uniquely to the quantum weak value in the minimal disturbance
  limit. As such, we address the controversy in the literature regarding the theoretical
  consistency of the quantum weak value by providing a more general theoretical framework
  and giving several examples of how that framework relates to existing experimental
  and theoretical results.
