abstract: 'We analyze the continuous measurement of two non-commuting observables
  for a qubit, and investigate whether the simultaneously observed noisy signals are
  consistent with the evolution of an equivalent classical system. Following the approach
  outlined by Leggett and Garg, we show that the readouts violate macrorealistic inequalities
  for arbitrarily short temporal correlations. Moreover, the derived inequalities
  are manifestly violated even in the absence of Hamiltonian evolution, unlike for
  Leggett-Garg inequalities that use a single continuous measurement. Such a violation
  should indicate the failure of at least one postulate of macrorealism: either physical
  quantities do not have well defined values at all times, or the measurement process
  itself disturbs what is being measured. For measurements of equal strength we are
  able to construct a classical stochastic model for a spin that perfectly emulates
  both the qubit evolution and the observed noisy signals, thus emulating the violations;
  interestingly, this model also requires an unphysical noise to emulate the readouts,
  which effectively restricts the ability of an observer to learn information about
  the spin.'
