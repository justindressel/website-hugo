abstract: We refute the widely held belief that the quantum weak value necessarily
  pertains to weak measurements. To accomplish this, we use the transverse position
  of a beam as the detector for the conditioned von Neumann measurement of a system
  observable. For any coupling strength, any initial states, and any choice of conditioning,
  the averages of the detector position and momentum are completely described by the
  real parts of three generalized weak values in the joint Hilbert space. Higher-order
  detector moments also have similar weak value expansions. Using the Wigner distribution
  of the initial detector state, we find compact expressions for these weak values
  within the reduced system Hilbert space. As an application of the approach, we show
  that for any Hermite-Gauss mode of a paraxial beam-like detector these expressions
  reduce to the real and imaginary parts of a single system weak value plus an additional
  weak-value-like contribution that only affects the momentum shift.
