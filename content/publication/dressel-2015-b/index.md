abstract: We present a comprehensive introduction to spacetime algebra that emphasizes
  its practicality and power as a tool for the study of electromagnetism. We carefully
  develop this natural (Clifford) algebra of the Minkowski spacetime geometry, with
  a particular focus on its intrinsic (and often overlooked) complex structure. Notably,
  the scalar imaginary that appears throughout the electromagnetic theory properly
  corresponds to the unit 4-volume of spacetime itself, and thus has physical meaning.
  The electric and magnetic fields are combined into a single complex and frame-independent
  bivector field, which generalizes the Riemann-Silberstein complex vector that has
  recently resurfaced in studies of the single photon wavefunction. The complex structure
  of spacetime also underpins the emergence of electromagnetic waves, circular polarizations,
  the normal variables for canonical quantization, the distinction between electric
  and magnetic charge, complex spinor representations of Lorentz transformations,
  and the dual (electric-magnetic field exchange) symmetry that produces helicity
  conservation in vacuum fields. This latter symmetry manifests as an arbitrary global
  phase of the complex field, motivating the use of a complex vector potential, along
  with an associated transverse and gauge-invariant bivector potential, as well as
  complex (bivector and scalar) Hertz potentials. Our detailed treatment aims to encourage
  the use of spacetime algebra as a readily available and mature extension to existing
  vector calculus and tensor methods that can greatly simplify the analysis of fundamentally
  relativistic objects like the electromagnetic field.
