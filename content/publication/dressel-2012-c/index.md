abstract: "We present a detailed motivation for and definition of the contextual values\
  \ of an observable, which were introduced by Dressel et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104\
  \ 240401 (2010)]. The theory of contextual values is a principled approach to the\
  \ generalized measurement of observables. It extends the well-established theory\
  \ of generalized state measurements by bridging the gap between partial state collapse\
  \ and the observables that represent physically relevant information about the system.\
  \ To emphasize the general utility of the concept, we first construct the full theory\
  \ of contextual values within an operational formulation of classical probability\
  \ theory, paying special attention to observable construction, detector coupling,\
  \ generalized measurement, and measurement disturbance. We then extend the results\
  \ to quantum probability theory built as a superstructure on the classical theory,\
  \ pointing out both the classical correspondences to and the full quantum generalizations\
  \ of both Lüder's rule and the Aharonov-Bergmann-Lebowitz rule in the process. As\
  \ such, our treatment doubles as a self-contained pedagogical introduction to the\
  \ essential components of the operational formulations for both classical and quantum\
  \ probability theory. We find in both cases that the contextual values of a system\
  \ observable form a generalized spectrum that is associated with the independent\
  \ outcomes of a partially correlated and generally ambiguous detector; the eigenvalues\
  \ are a special case when the detector is perfectly correlated and unambiguous.\
  \ To illustrate the approach, we apply the technique to both a classical example\
  \ of marble color detection and a quantum example of polarization detection. For\
  \ the quantum example we detail two devices: Fresnel reflection from a glass coverslip,\
  \ and continuous beam displacement from a calcite crystal. We also analyze the three-box\
  \ paradox to demonstrate that no negative probabilities are necessary in its analysis.\
  \ Finally, we provide a derivation of the quantum weak value as a limit point of\
  \ a pre- and postselected conditioned average and provide sufficient conditions\
  \ for the derivation to hold."
