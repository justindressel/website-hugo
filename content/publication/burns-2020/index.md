abstract: We construct a novel Lagrangian representation of acoustic field theory
  that describes the local vector properties of longitudinal (curl-free) acoustic
  fields. In particular, this approach accounts for the recently-discovered nonzero
  spin angular momentum density in inhomogeneous sound fields in fluids or gases.
  The traditional acoustic Lagrangian representation with a scalar potential is unable
  to describe such vector properties of acoustic fields adequately, which are however
  observable via local radiation forces and torques on small probe particles. By introducing
  a displacement vector potential analogous to the electromagnetic vector potential,
  we derive the appropriate canonical momentum and spin densities as conserved Noether
  currents. The results are consistent with recent theoretical analyses and experiments.
  Furthermore, by an analogy with dual-symmetric electromagnetic field theory that
  combines electric- and magnetic-potential representations, we put forward an acoustic
  spinor representation combining the scalar and vector representations. This approach
  also includes naturally coupling to sources. The strong analogies between electromagnetism
  and acoustics suggest further productive inquiry, particularly regarding the nature
  of the apparent spacetime symmetries inherent to acoustic fields.
