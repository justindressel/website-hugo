abstract: The state of a continuously monitored qubit evolves stochastically, exhibiting
  competition between coherent Hamiltonian dynamics and diffusive partial collapse
  dynamics that follow the measurement record. We couple these distinct types of dynamics
  together by linearly feeding the collected record for dispersive energy measurements
  directly back into a coherent Rabi drive amplitude. Such feedback turns the competition
  cooperative, and effectively stabilizes the qubit state near a target state. We
  derive the conditions for obtaining such dispersive state stabilization and verify
  the stabilization conditions numerically. We include common experimental nonidealities,
  such as energy decay, environmental dephasing, detector efficiency, and feedback
  delay, and show that the feedback delay has the most significant negative effect
  on the feedback protocol. Setting the measurement collapse timescale to be long
  compared to the feedback delay yields the best stabilization.
