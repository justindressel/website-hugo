abstract: 'We show that in the mathematical framework of the quantum theory the classical
  pigeonhole principle can be violated more directly than previously suggested, i.e.,
  in a setting closer to the traditional statement of the principle. We describe how
  the counterfactual reasoning of the paradox may be operationally grounded in the
  analysis of the tiny footprints left in the environment by the pigeons. After identifying
  the drawbacks of recent experiments of the quantum pigeonhole effect, we argue that
  a definitive experimental violation of the pigeonhole principle is still needed
  and propose such an implementation using modern quantum computing hardware: a superconducting
  circuit with transmon qubits.'
