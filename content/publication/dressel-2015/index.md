abstract: Weak values arise experimentally as conditioned averages of weak (noisy)
  observable measurements that minimally disturb an initial quantum state, and also
  as dynamical variables for reduced quantum state evolution even in the absence of
  measurement. These averages can exceed the eigenvalue range of the observable ostensibly
  being estimated, which has prompted considerable debate regarding their interpretation.
  Classical conditioned averages of noisy signals only show such anomalies if the
  quantity being measured is also disturbed prior to conditioning. This fact has recently
  been rediscovered, along with the question whether anomalous weak values are merely
  classical disturbance effects. Here we carefully review the role of the weak value
  as both a conditioned observable estimation and a dynamical variable, and clarify
  why classical disturbance models will be insufficient to explain the weak value
  unless they can also simulate other quantum interference phenomena.
