abstract: We consider the use of cyclic weak measurements to improve the sensitivity
  of weak-value amplification precision measurement schemes. Previous weak-value experiments
  have used only a small fraction of events, while discarding the rest through the
  process of \"post-selection.\" We extend this idea by considering recycling of events
  which are typically unused in a weak measurement. Here we treat a sequence of polarized
  laser pulses effectively trapped inside an interferometer using a Pockels cell and
  polarization optics. In principle, all photons can be post-selected, which will
  improve the measurement sensitivity. We first provide a qualitative argument for
  the expected improvements from recycling photons, followed by the exact result for
  the recycling of collimated beam pulses, and numerical calculations for diverging
  beams. We show that beam degradation effects can be mitigated via profile flipping
  or Zeno reshaping. The main advantage of such a recycling scheme is an effective
  power increase, while maintaining an amplified deflection.
