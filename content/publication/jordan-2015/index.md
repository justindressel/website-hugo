abstract: We examine the results of the paper “Precision metrology using weak measurements”
  (Zhang et al. arXiv:1310.5302, 2013) from a quantum state discrimination point of
  view. The Heisenberg scaling of the photon number for the precision of the interaction
  parameter between coherent light and a spin one-half particle (or pseudo-spin) has
  a simple interpretation in terms of the interaction rotating the quantum state to
  an orthogonal one. To achieve this scaling, the information must be extracted from
  the spin rather than from the coherent state of light, limiting the applications
  of the method to phenomena such as cross-phase modulation. We next investigate the
  effect of dephasing noise and show a rapid degradation of precision, in agreement
  with general results in the literature concerning Heisenberg scaling metrology.
  We also demonstrate that a von Neumann-type measurement interaction can display
  a similar effect with no system/meter entanglement.
