abstract: We examine the time reversal symmetry of quantum measurement sequences by
  introducing a forward and backward Janus sequence of measurements. If the forward
  sequence of measurements creates a sequence of quantum states in time, starting
  from an initial state and ending in a final state, then the backward sequence begins
  with the time-reversed final state, exactly retraces the intermediate states, and
  ends with the time-reversed initial state. We prove that such a sequence can always
  be constructed, showing that unless the measurements are ideal projections, it is
  impossible to tell if a given sequence of measurements is progressing forward or
  backward in time. A statistical arrow of time emerges only because typically the
  forward sequence is more probable than the backward sequence.
