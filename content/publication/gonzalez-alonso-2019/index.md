abstract: 'Out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) have received considerable recent
  attention as qualitative witnesses of information scrambling in many-body quantum
  systems. Theoretical discussions of OTOCs typically focus on closed systems, raising
  the question of their suitability as scrambling witnesses in realistic open systems.
  We demonstrate that nonclassicality of the quasiprobability distribution (QPD) behind
  the OTOC is a more sensitive witness for scrambling than the OTOC itself. Nonclassical
  features of the QPD evolve with time scales that are robust with respect to decoherence
  and are immune to false positives caused by decoherence. To reach this conclusion,
  we numerically simulate spin-chain dynamics and three experimental protocols for
  measuring OTOCs: interferometric, quantum-clock, and weak-measurement. We target
  implementations with quantum-computing hardware such as superconducting qubits or
  trapped ions.'
