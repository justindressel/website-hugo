abstract: We revisit the definitions of error and disturbance recently used in error-disturbance
  inequalities derived by Ozawa and others by expressing them in the reduced system
  space. The interpretation of the definitions as mean-squared deviations relies on
  an implicit assumption that is generally incompatible with the Bell-Kochen-Specker-Spekkens
  contextuality theorems, and which results in averaging the deviations over a non-positive-semidefinite
  joint quasiprobability distribution. For unbiased measurements, the error admits
  a concrete interpretation as the dispersion in the estimation of the mean induced
  by the measurement ambiguity. We demonstrate how to directly measure not only this
  dispersion but also every observable moment with the same experimental data, and
  thus demonstrate that perfect distributional estimations can have nonzero error
  according to this measure. We conclude that the inequalities using these definitions
  do not capture the spirit of Heisenberg's eponymous inequality, but do indicate
  a qualitatively different relationship between dispersion and disturbance that is
  appropriate for ensembles being probed by all outcomes of an apparatus. To reconnect
  with the discussion of Heisenberg, we suggest alternative definitions of error and
  disturbance that are intrinsic to a single apparatus outcome. These definitions
  naturally involve the retrodictive and interdictive states for that outcome, and
  produce complementarity and error-disturbance inequalities that have the same form
  as the traditional Heisenberg relation.
