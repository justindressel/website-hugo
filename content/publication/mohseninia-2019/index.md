abstract: Out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) have been proposed as a tool to
  witness quantum information scrambling in many-body system dynamics. These correlators
  can be understood as averages over nonclassical multi-time quasi-probability distributions
  (QPDs). These QPDs have more information, and their nonclassical features witness
  quantum information scrambling in a more nuanced way. However, their high dimensionality
  and nonclassicality make QPDs challenging to measure experimentally. We focus on
  the topical case of a many-qubit system and show how to obtain such a QPD in the
  laboratory using circuits with three and four sequential measurements. Averaging
  distinct values over the same measured distribution reveals either the OTOC or parameters
  of its QPD. Stronger measurements minimize experimental resources despite increased
  dynamical disturbance.
