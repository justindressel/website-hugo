abstract: In modern circuit QED architectures, superconducting transmon qubits are
  measured via the state-dependent phase and amplitude shift of a microwave field
  leaking from a coupled resonator. Determining this shift requires integrating the
  field quadratures for a nonzero duration, which can permit unwanted concurrent evolution.
  Here we investigate such dynamical degradation of the measurement fidelity caused
  by a detuned neighboring qubit. We find that in realistic parameter regimes, where
  the qubit ensemble-dephasing rate is slower than the qubit-qubit detuning, the joint
  qubit-qubit eigenstates are better discriminated by measurement than the bare states.
  Furthermore, we show that when the resonator leaks much more slowly than the qubit-qubit
  detuning, the measurement tracks the joint eigenstates nearly adiabatically. However,
  the measurement process also causes rare quantum jumps between the eigenstates.
  The rate of these jumps becomes significant if the resonator decay is comparable
  to or faster than the qubit-qubit detuning, thus significantly degrading the measurement
  fidelity in a manner reminiscent of energy relaxation processes.
