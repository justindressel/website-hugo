abstract: We present a set of practical benchmarks for N-qubit arrays that economically
  test the fidelity of achieving multi-qubit nonclassicality. The benchmarks are measurable
  correlators similar to 2-qubit Bell correlators, and are derived from a particular
  set of geometric structures from the N-qubit Pauli group. These structures prove
  the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) theorem, while the derived correlators witness
  genuine N-partite entanglement and establish a tight lower bound on the fidelity
  of particular stabilizer state preparations. The correlators need only M≤N+1 distinct
  measurement settings, as opposed to the 2^(2N)−1 settings that would normally be
  required to tomographically verify their associated stabilizer states. We optimize
  the measurements of these correlators for a physical array of qubits that can be
  nearest-neighbor-coupled using a circuit of controlled-Z gates with constant gate
  depth to form N-qubit linear cluster states. We numerically simulate the provided
  circuits for a realistic scenario with N=3,...,9 qubits, using ranges of T1 energy
  relaxation times, T2 dephasing times, and controlled-Z gate-fidelities consistent
  with Google's 9-qubit superconducting chip. The simulations verify the tightness
  of the fidelity bounds and witness nonclassicality for all nine qubits, while also
  showing ample room for improvement in chip performance.
