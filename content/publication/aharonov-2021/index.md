abstract: A recent criticism by Kunstatter et al. [Phys. Lett. A 384, 126686 (2020)]
  of a quantum setup violating the pigeon counting principle [Aharonov et al. PNAS
  113, 532 (2016)] is refuted. The quantum nature of the violation of the pigeonhole
  principle with pre- and postselection is clarified.
