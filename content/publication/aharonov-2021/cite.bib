 abstract = {A recent criticism by Kunstatter et al. [Phys. Lett. A 384, 126686 (2020)] of a quantum setup violating the pigeon counting principle [Aharonov et al. PNAS 113, 532 (2016)] is refuted. The quantum nature of the violation of the pigeonhole principle with pre- and postselection is clarified.},
