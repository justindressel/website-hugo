abstract: This thesis presents a general algebraic approach for indirectly measuring
  both classical and quantum observables, along with several applications. To handle
  the case of imperfectly correlated indirect detectors we generalize the observable
  spectra from eigenvalues to contextual values. Eigenvalues weight spectral idempotents
  to construct an observable, but contextual values can weight more general probability
  observables corresponding to indirect detector outcomes in order to construct the
  same observable. We develop the classical case using the logical approach of Bayesian
  probability theory to emphasize the generality of the concept. For the quantum case,
  we outline how to generalize the classical case in a straightforward manner by treating
  the classical sample space as a spectral idempotent decomposition of the enveloping
  algebra for a Lie group; such a sample space can then be rotated to other equivalent
  sample spaces through Lie group automorphisms. We give several classical and quantum
  examples to illustrate the utility of our approach. In particular, we use the approach
  to describe the theoretical derivation and experimental violation of generalized
  Leggett-Garg inequalities using a quantum optical setup. We also describe the measurement
  of which-path information using an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Finally,
  we provide a detailed and exact treatment of the quantum weak value, which appears
  as a general feature in conditioned observable measurements using a weakly correlated
  detector.
