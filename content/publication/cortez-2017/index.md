abstract: We investigate the determination of a Hamiltonian parameter in a quantum
  system undergoing continuous measurement. We demonstrate a computationally rapid
  yet statistically optimal method to estimate an unknown and possibly time-dependent
  parameter, where we maximize the likelihood of the observed stochastic readout.
  By dealing directly with the raw measurement record rather than the quantum state
  trajectories, the estimation can be performed while the data is being acquired,
  permitting continuous tracking of the parameter during slow drifts in real time.
  Furthermore, we incorporate realistic nonidealities, such as decoherence processes
  and measurement inefficiency. As an example, we focus on estimating the value of
  the Rabi frequency of a continuously measured qubit, and compare maximum likelihood
  estimation to a simpler fast Fourier transform. Using this example, we discuss how
  the quality of the estimation depends on both the strength and duration of the measurement;
  we also discuss the trade-off between the accuracy of the estimate and the sensitivity
  to drift as the estimation duration is varied.
