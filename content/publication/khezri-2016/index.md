abstract: Using circuit QED, we consider the measurement of a superconducting transmon
  qubit via a coupled microwave resonator. For ideally dispersive coupling, ringing
  up the resonator produces coherent states with frequencies matched to transmon energy
  states. Realistic coupling is not ideally dispersive, however, so transmon-resonator
  energy levels hybridize into joint eigenstate ladders of the Jaynes-Cummings type.
  Previous work has shown that ringing up the resonator approximately respects this
  ladder structure to produce a coherent state in the eigenbasis (a dressed coherent
  state). We numerically investigate the validity of this coherent state approximation
  to find two primary deviations. First, resonator ring-up leaks small stray populations
  into eigenstate ladders corresponding to different transmon states. Second, within
  an eigenstate ladder the transmon nonlinearity shears the coherent state as it evolves.
  We then show that the next natural approximation for this sheared state in the eigenbasis
  is a dressed squeezed state, and derive simple evolution equations for such states
  using a hybrid phase-Fock-space description.
