abstract: Unlike the real part of the generalized weak value of an observable, which
  can in a restricted sense be operationally interpreted as an idealized conditioned
  average of that observable in the limit of zero measurement disturbance, the imaginary
  part of the generalized weak value does not provide information pertaining to the
  observable being measured. What it does provide is direct information about how
  the initial state would be unitarily disturbed by the observable operator. Specifically,
  we provide an operational interpretation for the imaginary part of the generalized
  weak value as the logarithmic directional derivative of the post-selection probability
  along the unitary flow generated by the action of the observable operator. To obtain
  this interpretation, we revisit the standard von Neumann measurement protocol for
  obtaining the real and imaginary parts of the weak value and solve it exactly for
  arbitrary initial states and post-selections using the quantum operations formalism,
  which allows us to understand in detail how each part of the generalized weak value
  arises in the linear response regime. We also provide exact treatments of qubit
  measurements and Gaussian detectors as illustrative special cases, and show that
  the measurement disturbance from a Gaussian detector is purely decohering in the
  Lindblad sense, which allows the shifts for a Gaussian detector to be completely
  understood for any coupling strength in terms of a single complex weak value that
  involves the decohered initial state.
