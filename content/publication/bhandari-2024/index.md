  Kerr-cat qubits are bosonic qubits with autonomous protection against bit-flips. They have been studied widely using driven Superconducting Nonlinear Asymmetric Inductive eLement (SNAIL) oscillators. We theoretically investigate an alternate circuit for the Kerr-cat qubit, namely Symmetrically Threaded SQUIDs (STS). We perform the circuit analysis and derive the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKLS) master equation for the Kerr-cat qubit attached to a thermal environment. We find that the lifetime time of the coherent states (Tα) of the Kerr-cat qubit is the same in both the STS and SNAIL circuits for weak Kerr nonlinearity. However, the STS Kerr-cat qubits have the additional benefit of being resistant against higher order photon dissipation effects, resulting in significantly longer Tα even with stronger Kerr nonlinearity on the order of 10 MHz. We also examine the effects of strong flux driving and asymmetric Josephson junctions on Tα. Unlike the SNAIL design, we find a dip in Tα of the STS Kerr-cat qubit for weak two-photon drive. However, we show that the dip can be mitigated by applying a suitable drive-dependent detuning. With the proposed design and considering a cat size of 10 photons, we predict Tα of the order of tens of milliseconds even in the presence of multi-photon heating and dephasing effects. The robustness of the STS Kerr-cat qubit makes it a promising component for fault-tolerant quantum processors.
