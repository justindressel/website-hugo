abstract: We present a stochastic path integral formalism for continuous quantum measurement
  that enables the analysis of rare events using action methods. By doubling the quantum
  state space to a canonical phase space, we can write the joint probability density
  function of measurement outcomes and quantum state trajectories as a phase space
  path integral. Extremizing this action produces the most likely paths with boundary
  conditions defined by preselected and postselected states as solutions to a set
  of ordinary differential equations. As an application, we analyze continuous qubit
  measurement in detail and examine the structure of a quantum jump in the Zeno measurement
  regime.
