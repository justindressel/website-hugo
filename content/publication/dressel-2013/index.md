abstract: We demonstrate that quantum instruments can provide a unified operational
  foundation for quantum theory. Since these instruments directly correspond to laboratory
  devices, this foundation provides an alternate, more experimentally grounded, perspective
  from which to understand the elements of the traditional approach. We first show
  that in principle all measurable probabilities and correlations can be expressed
  entirely in terms of quantum instruments without the need for conventional quantum
  states or observables. We then show how these states and observables reappear as
  derived quantities by conditioning joint detection probabilities on the first or
  last measurement in a sequence as a preparation or a post-selection. Both predictive
  and retrodictive versions of states and observables appear in this manner, as well
  as more exotic bidirectional and interdictive states and observables that cannot
  be easily expressed using the traditional approach. We also revisit the conceptual
  meaning of the Heisenberg and Schr√∂dinger pictures of time evolution as applied
  to the various derived quantities, illustrate how detector loss can be included
  naturally, and discuss how the instrumental approach fully generalizes the time-symmetric
  two-vector approach of Aharonov emphet al. to any realistic laboratory situation.
