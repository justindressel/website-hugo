abstract: Large weak values have been used to amplify the sensitivity of a linear
  response signal for detecting changes in a small parameter, which has also enabled
  a simple method for precise parameter estimation. However, producing a large weak
  value requires a low postselection probability for an ancilla degree of freedom,
  which limits the utility of the technique. We propose an improvement to this method
  that uses entanglement to increase the efficiency. We show that by entangling and
  postselecting n ancillas, the postselection probability can be increased by a factor
  of n while keeping the weak value fixed (compared to n uncorrelated attempts with
  one ancilla), which is the optimal scaling with n that is expected from quantum
  metrology. Furthermore, we show the surprising result that the quantum Fisher information
  about the detected parameter can be almost entirely preserved in the postselected
  state, which allows the sensitive estimation to approximately saturate the relevant
  quantum Cram√©r-Rao bound. To illustrate this protocol we provide simple quantum
  circuits that can be implemented using current experimental realizations of three
  entangled qubits.
