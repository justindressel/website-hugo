abstract: 'We describe a method to perform any generalized purity-preserving measurement
  of a qubit with techniques tailored to superconducting systems. First, we consider
  two methods for realizing a two-outcome partial projection: using a thresholded
  continuous measurement in the circuit QED setup and using an indirect ancilla qubit
  measurement. Second, we decompose an arbitrary purity-preserving two-outcome measurement
  into single-qubit unitary rotations and a partial projection. Third, we systematically
  reduce any multiple-outcome measurement to a sequence of such two-outcome measurements
  and unitary operations. Finally, we consider how to define suitable fidelity measures
  for multiple-outcome generalized measurements.'
