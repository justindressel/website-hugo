abstract: "Two topics, evolving rapidly in separate fields, were combined recently:\
  \ the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) signals quantum-information scrambling\
  \ in many-body systems. The Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability represents operators\
  \ in quantum optics. The OTOC was shown to equal a moment of a summed quasiprobability\
  \ [Yunger Halpern, Phys. Rev. A 95, 012120 (2017)]. That quasiprobability, we argue,\
  \ is an extension of the KD distribution. We explore the quasiprobability's structure\
  \ from experimental, numerical, and theoretical perspectives. First, we simplify\
  \ and analyze Yunger Halpern's weak-measurement and interference protocols for measuring\
  \ the OTOC and its quasiprobability. We decrease, exponentially in system size,\
  \ the number of trials required to infer the OTOC from weak measurements. We also\
  \ construct a circuit for implementing the weak-measurement scheme. Next, we calculate\
  \ the quasiprobability (after coarse graining) numerically and analytically: we\
  \ simulate a transverse-field Ising model first. Then, we calculate the quasiprobability\
  \ averaged over random circuits, which model chaotic dynamics. The quasiprobability,\
  \ we find, distinguishes chaotic from integrable regimes. We observe nonclassical\
  \ behaviors: the quasiprobability typically has negative components. It becomes\
  \ nonreal in some regimes. The onset of scrambling breaks a symmetry that bifurcates\
  \ the quasiprobability, as in classical-chaos pitchforks. Finally, we present mathematical\
  \ properties. We define an extended KD quasiprobability that generalizes the KD\
  \ distribution. The quasiprobability obeys a Bayes-type theorem, for example, that\
  \ exponentially decreases the memory required to calculate weak values, in certain\
  \ cases. A time-ordered correlator analogous to the OTOC, insensitive to quantum-information\
  \ scrambling, depends on a quasiprobability closer to a classical probability. This\
  \ work not only illuminates the OTOC's underpinnings, but also generalizes quasiprobability\
  \ theory and motivates immediate-future weak-measurement challenges."
