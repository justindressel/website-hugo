abstract: We generalize the derivation of Leggett-Garg inequalities to systematically
  treat a larger class of experimental situations by allowing multi-particle correlations,
  invasive detection, and ambiguous detector results. Furthermore, we show how many
  such inequalities may be tested simultaneously with a single setup. As a proof of
  principle, we violate several such two-particle inequalities with data obtained
  from a polarization-entangled biphoton state and a semi-weak polarization measurement
  based on Fresnel reflection. We also point out a non- trivial connection between
  specific two-party Leggett-Garg inequality violations and convex sums of strange
  weak values.
