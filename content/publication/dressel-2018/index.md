abstract: For systems of controllable qubits, we provide a method for experimentally
  obtaining a useful class of multitime correlators using sequential generalized measurements
  of arbitrary strength. Specifically, if a correlator can be expressed as an average
  of nested (anti)commutators of operators that square to the identity, then that
  correlator can be determined exactly from the average of a measurement sequence.
  As a relevant example, we provide quantum circuits for measuring multiqubit out-of-time-order
  correlators (OTOCs) using optimized control-Z or ZX -90 two-qubit gates common in
  superconducting transmon implementations.
