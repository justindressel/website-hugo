abstract: We explore the nature of the classical propagation of light through media
  with strong frequency-dependent dispersion in the presence of a gravitational field.
  In the weak field limit, gravity causes a redshift of the optical frequency, which
  the slow-light medium converts into a spatially varying index of refraction. This
  results in the bending of a light ray in the medium. We further propose experimental
  techniques to amplify and detect the phenomenon using weak value measurements. Independent
  heuristic and rigorous derivations of this effect are given.
