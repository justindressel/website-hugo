abstract: We review and re-examine the description and separation of the spin and
  orbital angular momenta (AM) of an electromagnetic field in free space. While the
  spin and orbital AM of light are not separately meaningful physical quantities in
  orthodox quantum mechanics or classical field theory, these quantities are routinely
  measured and used for applications in optics. A meaningful quantum description of
  the spin and orbital AM of light was recently provided by several authors, which
  describes separately conserved and measurable integral values of these quantities.
  However, the electromagnetic field theory still lacks corre- sponding locally conserved
  spin and orbital AM currents. In this paper, we construct these missing spin and
  orbital AM densities and fluxes that satisfy the proper continuity equations. We
  show that these are physically measurable and conserved quantities. These are, however,
  not Lorentz-covariant, so only make sense in the single laboratory reference frame
  of the measurement probe. The fluxes we derive improve the canonical (nonconserved)
  spin and orbital AM fluxes, and include a ‘spin–orbit’ term that describes the spin–orbit
  interaction effects observed in nonparaxial optical fields. We also consider both
  standard and dual-symmetric versions of the electromagnetic field theory. Applying
  the general theory to nonparaxial optical vortex beams validates our results and
  allows us to discriminate between earlier approaches to the problem. Ourtreatment
  yields the complete and consistent description of the spin and orbital AM of free
  Maxwell fields in both quantum-mechanical and field-theory approaches.
