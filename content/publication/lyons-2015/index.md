abstract: We improve the precision of the interferometric weak-value-based beam deflection
  measurement by introducing a power recycling mirror, creating a resonant cavity.
  This results in all the light exiting to the detector with a large deflection, thus
  eliminating the inefficiency of the rare postselection. The signal-to-noise ratio
  of the deflection is itself magnified by the weak value. We discuss ways to realize
  this proposal, using a transverse beam filter and different cavity designs.
