abstract: Since its introduction 25 years ago, the quantum weak value has gradually
  transitioned from a theoretical curiosity to a practical laboratory tool. While
  its utility is apparent in the recent explosion of weak value experiments, its interpretation
  has historically been a subject of confusion. Here a pragmatic introduction to the
  weak value in terms of measurable quantities is presented, along with an explanation
  for how it can be determined in the laboratory. Further, its application to three
  distinct experimental techniques is reviewed. First, as a large interaction parameter
  it can amplify small signals above technical background noise. Second, as a measurable
  complex value it enables novel techniques for direct quantum state and geometric
  phase determination. Third, as a conditioned average of generalized observable eigenvalues
  it provides a measurable window into nonclassical features of quantum mechanics.
  In this selective review, a single experimental configuration to discuss and clarify
  each of these applications is used.
