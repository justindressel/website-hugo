abstract: In their original framework weak values must be measured by weak measurements
  that are minimally disturbing, meaning that the coupling between an investigated
  quantum system and a measurement device has no influence on the evolution of the
  system. However, under certain circumstances this weakness of the interaction is
  not necessary. In that case weak values can still be exactly determined from the
  statistics of the outcomes of arbitrary-strength generalized measurements. Here,
  we report an experimental procedure for neutron matter-waves that extends the notion
  of generalized eigenvalues for the neutron's path system to allow the exact determination
  of weak values using both strong and weak interactions. Experimental evidence is
  given that strong interactions outperform weak ones both for precision and accuracy.
