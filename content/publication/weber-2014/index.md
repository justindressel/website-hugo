title: Mapping the optimal route between two quantum states
subtitle: ''
summary: "Classical systems are unmoved when a measurement is performed. Not so quantum systems, where continuous monitoring can direct the quantum state along a random path. Steve Weber et al. have tracked the quantum trajectories in a qubit, consisting of two aluminum paddles connected by a tunable Josephson junction deposited on silicon. The authors manage to determine which of the possible paths between an initial and a final quantum state is the most probable and show that these 'optimal paths' are in agreement with the route predicted by theory, a quantum relative of the principle of least action that defines the correct path linking two points in space and time in classical mechanics. As well as giving insights into the interplay between measurement dynamics and evolution of a system, this work opens up new possibilities for first-principles synthesis of control sequences for complex quantum systems and in information processing."

abstract: A central feature of quantum mechanics is that a measurement result is intrinsically
  probabilistic. Consequently, continuously monitoring a quantum system will randomly
  perturb its natural unitary evolution. The ability to control a quantum system in
  the presence of these fluctuations is of increasing importance in quantum information
  processing and finds application in fields ranging from nuclear magnetic resonance
  to chemical synthesis. A detailed understanding of this stochastic evolution is
  essential for the development of optimized control methods. Here we reconstruct
  the individual quantum trajectories of a superconducting circuit that evolves under
  the competing influences of continuous weak measurement and Rabi drive. By tracking
  individual trajectories that evolve between any chosen initial and final states,
  we can deduce the most probable path through quantum state space. These pre- and
  post-selected quantum trajectories also reveal the optimal detector signal in the
  form of a smooth, time-continuous function that connects the desired boundary conditions.
  Our investigation reveals the rich interplay between measurement dynamics, typically
  associated with wavefunction collapse, and unitary evolution of the quantum state
  as described by the Schroedinger equation. These results and the underlying theory,
  based on a principle of least action, reveal the optimal route from initial to final
  states, and may inform new quantum control methods for state steering and information
  processing.
