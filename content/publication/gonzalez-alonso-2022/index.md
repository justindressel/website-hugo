abstract: While classical chaos has been successfully characterized with consistent
  theories and intuitive techniques, such as with the use of Lyapunov exponents, quantum
  chaos is still poorly understood, as well as its relation with multi-partite entanglement
  and information scrambling. We consider a benchmark system, the kicked top model,
  which displays chaotic behaviour in the classical version, and proceed to characterize
  the quantum case with a thorough diagnosis of the growth of chaos and entanglement
  in time. As a novel tool for the characterization of quantum chaos, we introduce
  for this scope the quasi-probability distribution behind the out-of-time-ordered
  correlator (OTOC). We calculate the cumulative nonclassicality of this distribution,
  which has already been shown to outperform the simple use of OTOC as a probe to
  distinguish between integrable and nonintegrable Hamiltonians. To provide a thorough
  comparative analysis, we contrast the behavior of the nonclassicality with entanglement
  measures, such as the tripartite mutual information of the Hamiltonian as well as
  the entanglement entropy. We find that systems whose initial states would lie in
  the \"sea of chaos\" in the classical kicked-top model, exhibit, as they evolve
  in time, characteristics associated with chaotic behavior and entanglement production
  in closed quantum systems. We corroborate this indication by capturing it with this
  novel OTOC-based measure.
