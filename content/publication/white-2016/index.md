title: Preserving entanglement during weak measurement demonstrated with a violation
  of the Bell--Leggett--Garg inequality
subtitle: ''
summary: 'Scientists in the US have developed a method to evaluate the properties of complex quantum states without causing their destruction. A team at the University of California Santa Barbara led by John Martinis verified that the properties of entangled quantum states can be probed using weak measurements. By extracting only small parts of quantum information in a single measurement, weak measurements avoid the problem whereby quantum states are destroyed when the information contained in them is measured. Although this has been successfully demonstrated for single quantum states, it remained unclear if weak measurements were compatible with more complicated entangled systems. By implementing an experimental test that verifies with high accuracy the preservation of those entangled states in measurements, the researchers have made it possible to probe the properties of qubits in complex quantum computing schemes.'

abstract: Weak measurement has provided new insight into the nature of quantum measurement
  by demonstrating the ability to extract average state information without fully
  projecting the system. For single qubit measurements, this partial projection has
  been demonstrated with violations of the Leggett-Garg inequality. Here we investigate
  the effects of weak measurement on a maximally entangled Bell state through application
  of the Hybrid Bell-Leggett-Garg inequality (BLGI) on a linear chain of four transmon
  qubits. By correlating the results of weak ancilla measurements with subsequent
  projective readout, we achieve a violation of the BLGI with 27 standard deviations
  of certainty.
