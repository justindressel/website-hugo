 abstract = {Weak measurement has provided new insight into the nature of quantum measurement by demonstrating the ability to extract average state information without fully projecting the system. For single qubit measurements, this partial projection has been demonstrated with violations of the Leggett-Garg inequality. Here we investigate the effects of weak measurement on a maximally entangled Bell state through application of the Hybrid Bell-Leggett-Garg inequality (BLGI) on a linear chain of four transmon qubits. By correlating the results of weak ancilla measurements with subsequent projective readout, we achieve a violation of the BLGI with 27 standard deviations of certainty.},
