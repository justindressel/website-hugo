abstract: >
  Superoscillatory, band-limited functions oscillate faster than their fastest Fourier component. Superoscillations have been intensively explored recently as they give rise to many out-of-the-spectrum phenomena entailing both fundamental and applied significance. We experimentally demonstrate a form of superoscillations which is manifested by light apparently coming from a source located far away from the actual one. These superoscillations are sensed through sharp transverse shifts in the local wave vector at the minima of a pinhole diffraction pattern. We call this phenomenon "optical ventriloquism."
