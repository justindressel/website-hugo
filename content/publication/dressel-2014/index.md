abstract: By combining the postulates of macrorealism with Bell-locality, we derive
  a qualitatively different hybrid inequality that avoids two loopholes that commonly
  appear in Leggett-Garg and Bell inequalities. First, locally-invasive measurements
  can be used, which avoids the \"clumsiness\" Leggett-Garg inequality loophole. Second,
  a single experimental ensemble with fixed analyzer settings is sampled, which avoids
  the \"disjoint sampling\" Bell inequality loophole. The derived hybrid inequality
  has the same form as the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt Bell inequality; however, its
  quantum violation intriguingly requires weak measurements. A realistic explanation
  of an observed violation requires either the failure of Bell-locality, or a preparation-conspiracy
  of finely tuned and nonlocally-correlated noise. Modern superconducting and optical
  systems are poised to implement this test.
