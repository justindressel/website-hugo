abstract: The quantum Zeno effect is the suppression of Hamiltonian evolution by repeated
  observation, which pins the system to an eigenstate of the measurement observable.
  Using measurement alone, control of the state can be achieved if the observable
  is slowly varied, so that the state tracks the now time-dependent eigenstate. We
  demonstrate this using a circuit-QED readout technique that couples to a dynamically
  controllable observable of a qubit. Continuous monitoring of the measurement record
  allows us to detect an escape from the eigenstate, thus serving as a built-in form
  of error detection. We show this by postselecting on realizations with high fidelity
  with respect to the target state. Our dynamical measurement operator technique offers
  a new tool for numerous forms of quantum feedback protocols, including adaptive
  measurements and rapid state purification.
