abstract: We investigate the statistical arrow of time for a quantum system being
  monitored by a sequence of measurements. For a continuous qubit measurement example,
  we demonstrate that time-reversed evolution is always physically possible, provided
  that the measurement record is also negated. Despite this restoration of dynamical
  reversibility, a statistical arrow of time emerges, and may be quantified by the
  log-likelihood difference between forward and backward propagation hypotheses. We
  then show that such reversibility is a universal feature of non-projective measurements,
  with forward or backward Janus measurement sequences that are time-reversed inverses
  of each other.
