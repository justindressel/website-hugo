abstract: We review and clarify the sufficient conditions for uniquely defining the
  generalized weak value as the weak limit of a conditioned average using the contextual
  values formalism introduced in Dressel, Agarwal and Jordan (2010 Phys. Rev. Lett.
  http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.240401). We also respond to criticism
  of our work by Parrott (arXiv:1105.4188v1) concerning a proposed counter-example
  to the uniqueness of the definition of the generalized weak value. The counter-example
  does not satisfy our prescription in the case of an underspecified measurement context.
  We show that when the contextual values formalism is properly applied to this example,
  a natural interpretation of the measurement emerges and the unique definition in
  the weak limit holds. We also prove a theorem regarding the uniqueness of the definition
  under our sufficient conditions for the general case. Finally, a second proposed
  counter-example by Parrott (arXiv:1105.4188v6) is shown not to satisfy the sufficiency
  conditions for the provided theorem.
