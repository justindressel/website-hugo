abstract: A novel method was recently proposed and experimentally realized for characterizing
  a quantum state by directly measuring its complex probability amplitudes in a particular
  basis using so-called weak values. Recently Vallone and Dequal showed theoretically
  that weak measurements are not a necessary condition to determine the weak value
  [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 040502 (2016)]. Here we report a measurement scheme used
  in a matter-wave interferometric experiment in which the neutron path system's quantum
  state was characterized via direct measurements using both strong and weak interactions.
  Experimental evidence is given that strong interactions outperform weak ones. Our
  results are not limited to neutron interferometry, but can be used in a wide range
  of quantum systems.
