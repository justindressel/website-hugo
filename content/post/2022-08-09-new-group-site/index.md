The group website has now been migrated to a more modern and mobile-friendly design.

<!--more-->

The older site was hand-rolled Bootstrap code circa 2015, which was getting increasingly difficult to maintain as both group members and publications increased. This updated design should make it much simpler to update regularly, since it is generated via [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [WowChemy Academic](https://wowchemy.com) tools.
