Professor Alexander is a theoretical physicist specializing in cosmology, particle physics and quantum gravity (String Theory and Loop Quantum Gravity). He received his BSc (1993) from Haverford College and PhD (2000) from Brown University, held postdoctoral research fellowships at Imperial College, London and The Stanford University Linear Accelerator Center, and previously held faculty positions at Penn State, Haverford College and Dartmouth.

He also explores interconnections between music, physics, mathematics and technology though recordings, performance, teaching and public lectures. He has performed and collaborated with Will Calhoun, Brian Eno, Marc Cary, Vernon Reid, Ronnie Burrage and Jaron Lanier on these intersections.
