SOFTWARE ENGINEER | PHYSICIST | COMPOSER - I excel at understanding and communicating across business functions and stakeholders. Go-to-person for troubleshooting, investigative discovery, and new systems design. Affinity for architecture and modeling abstract systems, specifically when applied to business problems.

Audio is the way to my heart, and working with artists is my passion. Games are a great nexus of these passions. I love fantasy epics (currently reading The Wheel of Time). In my off-time, I play many creative sandbox video games like Kerbal Space Program, Factorio, and Cities Skylines, but I enjoy Overwatch, Hearthstone, and Starcraft II as well as any well-written narrative game.
