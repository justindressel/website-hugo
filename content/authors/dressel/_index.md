Dr. Justin Dressel primarily researches quantum information science, quantum computation, and the foundations of quantum physics. These fields are natural intersection points between physics, mathematics, and computer science.

Modern experimental techniques have enabled the unprecedented control of quantum systems, which has fueled his interest in helping to develop active quantum technology as part of the "Second Quantum Revolution." This new technology has catalyzed the rapidly growing fields of quantum computation and quantum simulation and has enabled precision experimental tests of foundational physics. His recent research involves superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamics, weak and continuous quantum measurements, machine learning for physics, and geometric (Clifford) algebraic methods in relativistic physics. Though the bulk of his work is theoretical in nature, he enjoys frequent and close collaborations with experimental teams at a variety of institutions.
