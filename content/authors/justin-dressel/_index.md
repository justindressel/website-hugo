Dr. Justin Dressel is an Associate Professor of Physics at Chapman University, in both the Schmid College of Science and Technology and the Institute for Quantum Studies. He received his Ph.D. in Physics at the University of Rochester in 2013 under the advisement of Dr. Andrew N. Jordan, after which he worked as a postdoctoral scholar at RIKEN in Wako-shi, Japan under the advisement of Dr. Franco Nori, as well as the University of California, Riverside under the advisement of Dr. Alexander Korotkov. He joined the faculty at Chapman University in 2015 as an Assistant Professor and was awarded tenure in 2019. 

Dr. Justin Dressel primarily researches quantum information science, quantum computation, and the foundations of quantum physics. These fields are natural intersection points between physics, mathematics, and computer science. His recent research has revolved around the development of superconducting quantum circuits for quantum computation in collaboration with experimental groups at Google, UC Santa Barbara, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, USC, and UC Berkeley.

<!-- Modern experimental techniques have enabled the unprecedented control of quantum systems, which has fueled his interest in helping to develop active quantum technology as part of the "Second Quantum Revolution." This new technology has catalyzed the rapidly growing fields of quantum computation and quantum simulation and has enabled precision experimental tests of foundational physics. His recent research involves superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamics, weak and continuous quantum measurements, machine learning for physics, and geometric (Clifford) algebraic methods in relativistic physics. Though the bulk of his work is theoretical in nature, he enjoys frequent and close collaborations with experimental teams at a variety of institutions. -->
