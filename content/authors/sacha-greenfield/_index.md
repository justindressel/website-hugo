I'm currently a graduate student at USC, working jointly between the groups of Dr. Justin Dressel at Chapman and Dr. Eli Levenson-Falk at USC. I am interested in understanding the fundamentals of quantum measurement through weak measurement feedback experiments. I am interested in how observing really "weird" dynamics in real experiments could clarify foundational questions in quantum mechanics. When I'm not doing physics, you'll probably find me doing Zen Buddhist stuff, learning to dance, and trying to maintain my sanity during corona.
