Harvard PhD candidate in Physics and Computational Science with an open-mind towards internships in a variety of computational fields. My current research projects include: integrating information theory metrics to optimize (quantum) machine learning protocols, designing ultra-sparse materials with applications in all-optical quantum computing, and developing efficient, dynamic, and intuitive software for the large-scale calculations that physics throws my way. While physics is my specialty, finding powerful solutions to non-trivial problems with human impact is my passion - when a worthwhile endeavor requires new knowledge, I don't hesitate to acquire it.
